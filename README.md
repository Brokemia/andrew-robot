# Reverse Engineering the Andrew Robot
Andrew is a robot designed to automatically perform bioscience experiments through pipetting precise quantities of liquids. The original Andrew robots are no longer supported by [the manufacturer](https://www.andrewalliance.com/). Additionally, the existing software is old and based on Adobe AIR, a product similar to Flash, which is no longer supported by Adobe. To revitalize old robots, this repo exists to document the hardware and software of the Andrew robots, along with providing a Python library to interface with the robot.
