Andrew Alliance provides a solution to control the Andrew robot. This software is no longer receiving updates and uses outdated technology, which is part of the reason for this project.

AndrewOS is the driver software to communicate with and control the robot. [Download](https://www.andrewalliance.com/AndrewOSInstaller.exe)

AndrewLab is the design tool to create high-level lab procedures for the robot to follow. [Download](https://www.andrewalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/andrewlab-1.5.8.air) \
AndrewLab requires [Adobe AIR](https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime) to run.
